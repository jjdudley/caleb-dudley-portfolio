          Caleb Dudley is a freelance editorial / fine
          art photographer and videographer with expertise in both digital and analog processes as well as experimental media.

          The driving force behind Calebâ€™s work is his uniquely gentle
          perspective into the world. His work, often described as feeling
          fragile, slowly reveals the vulnerability and sensitivity at the core of the human experience.
          <br /><br/>
          Caleb currently resides in Brooklyn, NY. He is a graduate of The Fashion Institute of Technology, where he studied alongside some of the world's most passionate collegiate artists.
